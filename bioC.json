After possible removal of steady state expression, steady-scale variance, noise and experimental artifacts, and after re-applying SVD to the normalized data, a summary html report of the eigensystem is generated, containing among others polar plots of the assays and features, a table with the list of features sortable according to their coordinates, radius and phase in the polar plot, and a visualization of the data sorted according to the two selected eigenfeatures and eigenassays with colored feature/assay annotation information when provided. This gives a global picture of the dynamics of expression/intensity levels, in which individual features and assays are classified in groups of similar regulation and function or similar cellular state and biological phenotype."}, {"authors": "Tengfei Yin [aut], Michael Lawrence [aut, ths, cre], Dianne Cook [aut, ths], Johannes Rainer [ctb]", "downloads_month": "3008", "name": "biovizBase", "license": "Artistic-2.0", "tags": ["Infrastructure", "Preprocessing", "Software", "Visualization"], "downloads_total": "2670", "page": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biovizBase.html", "description": "The biovizBase package is designed to provide a set of utilities, color schemes and conventions for genomic data.

To take into account the directionality of gene expression changes, gCMAPQuery introduces the SignedGeneSet class, directly extending GeneSet from the GSEABase package.

Testing is addressed through several test statistics: global likelihood ratio test (E2), Bartholomew 1961, Barlow et al. 1972 and Robertson et al. 1988), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus (1976), the M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007). The p-values of the global likelihood ratio test (E2) are obtained using the exact distribution and permutations. The other four test statistics are obtained using permutations. Several p-values adjustment are provided: Bonferroni, Holm (1979), Hochberg (1988), and Sidak procedures for controlling the family-wise Type I error rate (FWER), and BH (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) and BY (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001) procedures are used for controlling the FDR. The inference is based on resampling methods, which control the False Discovery Rate (FDR), for both permutations (Ge et al., 2003) and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, Tusher et al., 2001). Clustering methods are outsourced from CRAN packages ORCME, ORIClust. The package ORCME is based on delta-clustering method (Cheng and Church, 2000) and ORIClust on Order Restricted Information Criterion (Liu et al., 2009), both perform same task but from different perspective and their outputs are clusters of genes. Additionally, profile selection for given gene based on Generalized ORIC (Kuiper et al., 2014) from package goric and permutation test for E2 based on package orQA are included in IsoGene-GUI.

As core functionality, kebabs implements following sequence kernels: spectrum kernel, mismatch kernel, gappy pair kernel, and motif kernel. Apart from an efficient implementation of standard position-independent functionality, the kernels are extended in a novel way to take the position of patterns into account for the similarity measure. Because of the flexibility of the kernel formulation, other kernels like the weighted degree kernel or the shifted weighted degree kernel with constant weighting of positions are included as special cases. An annotation-specific variant of the kernels uses annotation information placed along the sequence together with the patterns in the sequence. The package allows for the generation of a kernel matrix or an explicit feature representation in dense or sparse format for all available kernels which can be used with methods implemented in other R packages. With focus on SVM-based methods, kebabs provides a framework which simplifies the usage of existing SVM implementations in kernlab, e1071, and LiblineaR. Binary and multi-class classification as well as regression tasks can be used in a unified way without having to deal with the different functions, parameters, and formats of the selected SVM. As support for choosing hyperparameters, the package provides cross validation - including grouped cross validation, grid search and model selection functions. For easier biological interpretation of the results, the package computes feature weights for all SVMs and prediction profiles which show the contribution of individual sequence positions to the prediction result and indicate the relevance of sequence sections for the learning result and the underlying biological functions."}, {"authors": "Jitao David Zhang, with inputs from Paul Shannon", "downloads_month": "1296", "name": "KEGGgraph", "license": "GPL (>= 2)", "tags": ["GraphAndNetwork", "KEGG", "Pathways", "Software", "Visualization"], "downloads_total": "1038", "page": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KEGGgraph.html", "description": "KEGGGraph is an interface between KEGG pathway and graph object as well as a collection of tools to analyze, dissect and visualize these graphs.

However, the vast majority of these disease-associated SNPs lie in the non-coding part of the genome, and are likely to affect regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, rather than function of a protein. Thus, to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic traits and diseases, it becomes increasingly important to study the effect of a SNP on nearby molecular traits such as chromatin environment or transcription factor (TF) binding. Towards this aim, we developed SNPhood, a user-friendly *Bioconductor* R package to investigate and visualize the local neighborhood of a set of SNPs of interest for NGS data such as chromatin marks or transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-Seq or RNA- Seq experiments. SNPhood comprises a set of easy-to-use functions to extract, normalize and summarize reads for a genomic region, perform various data quality checks, normalize read counts using additional input files, and to cluster and visualize the regions according to the binding pattern. The regions around each SNP can be binned in a user-defined fashion to allow for analysis of very broad patterns as well as a detailed investigation of specific binding shapes. Furthermore, SNPhood supports the integration with genotype information to investigate and visualize genotype-specific binding patterns. Finally, SNPhood can be employed for determining, investigating, and visualizing allele-specific binding patterns around the SNPs of interest."}, {"authors": "Christian Arnold, Judith Zaugg", "downloads_month": "0", "name": "SNPhoodData", "license": "R (>= 3.2)", "tags": ["ExperimentData"], "downloads_total": "1", "page": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/SNPhoodData.html", "description": "This companion package for SNPhood provides some example datasets of a larger size than allowed for the SNPhood package.

The model incorporates data calibration (a.k.a. normalization), a model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity, and a variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between transformed intensities are analogous to \"normalized log-ratios\". However, in contrast to the latter, their variance is independent of the mean, and they are usually more sensitive and specific in detecting differential transcription."}, {"authors": "VJ Carey <stvjc at channing.harvard.edu>", "downloads_month": "161", "name": "vtpnet", "license": "Artistic-2.0", "tags": ["Network", "Software"], "downloads_total": "104", "page": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/vtpnet.html", "description": "variant-transcription factor-phenotype networks, inspired by Maurano et al., Science (2012), PMID 22955828"}, {"authors": "Leonard C Schalkwyk, Ruth Pidsley, Chloe CY Wong, with functions contributed by Nizar Touleimat, Matthieu Defrance, Andrew Teschendorff, Jovana Maksimovic, Tyler Gorrie-Stone, Louis El Khouri", "downloads_month": "421", "name": "wateRmelon", "license": "GPL-3", "tags": ["DNAMethylation", "Microarray", "Preprocessing", "QualityControl", "Software", "TwoChannel"], "downloads_total": "382", "page": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/wateRmelon.html", "description": "15 flavours of betas and three performance metrics, with methods for objects produced by methylumi and minfi packages."}, {"authors": "Federico Comoglio and Cem Sievers", "downloads_month": "171", "name": "wavClusteR", "license": "GPL-2", "tags": ["Bayesian", "RIPSeq", "RNASeq", "Sequencing", "Software", "Technology"], "downloads_total": "109", "page": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/wavClusteR.html", "description": "The package provides an integrated pipeline for the analysis of PAR-CLIP data. PAR-CLIP-induced transitions are first discriminated from sequencing errors, SNPs and additional non-experimental sources by a non- parametric mixture model. The protein binding sites (clusters) are then resolved at high resolution and cluster statistics are estimated using a rigorous Bayesian framework. Post-processing of the results, data export for UCSC genome browser visualization and motif search analysis are provided. In addition, the package allows to integrate RNA-Seq data to estimate the False Discovery Rate of cluster detection. Key functions support parallel multicore computing. Note: while wavClusteR was designed for PAR-CLIP data analysis, it can be applied to the analysis of other NGS data obtained from experimental procedures that induce nucleotide substitutions (e.g. BisSeq)."}, {"authors": "Kristof De Beuf <kristof.debeuf at UGent.be>, Peter Pipelers <peter.pipelers at ugent.be> and Lieven Clement <lieven.clement at gmail.com>", "downloads_month": "177", "name": "waveTiling", "license": "GPL (>=2)", "tags": ["DifferentialExpression", "GeneExpression", "Microarray", "Software", "TimeCourse"], "downloads_total": "111", "page": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/waveTiling.html", "description": "This package is designed to conduct transcriptome analysis for tiling arrays based on fast wavelet-based functional models."}, {"authors": "Seth Falcon", "downloads_month": "209", "name": "weaver", "license": "GPL-2", "tags": ["Infrastructure", "Software"], "downloads_total": "144", "page": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/weaver.html", "description": "This package provides enhancements on the Sweave() function in the base package.
